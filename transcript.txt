the highlight of the Nvidia keynote for me was when CEO Jensen Hong quipped that if you bought an RTX 490 that was probably the best investment you could make I mean just consider all the entertainment happiness that it could give you but uh one small thing Mr pong when Nvidia launched the RTX 490 your stock price was about $150 so if someone had bought that instead of a 4090 as their investment well hey good news because they should be able to comfortably afford a 5090 or 10 as for everybody else well unfortunately envidia doesn't take happiness so you're going to be trading a truly princely sum for the privilege of experiencing their latest and greatest but affordability aside this was a heck of an event Nvidia kicked it off with the most beautiful real-time rendered demo that I have ever seen and Then followed it up with a slw of new RTX Blackwell 50 Series gpus with brand new technologies like dlss 4.0 dlss Transformer neural faces and some of the gpus even have prices that taken at face value might actually be kind of exciting Jensen claimed on stage that the 5070 will offer 490 levels of performance at $549 then immediately followed that up with a huge red flag saying that this feat would be impossible without AI so I was all like sick woo and then I was all like see well no sooner did I say that than some Burly guys in green showed up and said all right you cynical Tech tipping son of a we're going to show it to you right now but you got to do the thing the thing I said yeah the thing all right the thing the segue to our sponsor Wicked cushions give your headset a new lease on life with Wicked cushions replacement ear pads they offer impeccable comfort and more than a dozen awesome looks get your own cushions using our Link in the video description today we'll get to some of the AI and data center stuff from the keynote but first I want to talk GeForce and right now we are behind the scenes getting the first ever Hands-On with the RTX 590 well we aren't yet now we are they didn't tell me I could touch it but they can't stop me they way over there before we go deeper there are a couple of things that stood out immediately from their Sizzle video for this thing I mean yeah there's the incredibly compact PCB with the state-of-the-art power delivery that enables a sick dual fan dual slot cooler with pass through for both of the fans that's right both of these fans are blowing right through the cart but this thank you no more need for fire prone right angle adapters to clean up your cable men management an angled power connector okay okay lonus it has a nice cable but what about the specs oh I've got specs let me put it this way if you have a 4090 right now the 90 is the GPU that she tells you not to worry about in raw numbers here's what that looks like this is going to be one heck of an upgrade I can't wait to see it in action so why am I waiting let's do it here relegated to the floor like a common chicken is the previous King the RTX 490 why don't we start there Nvidia can't let me show you guys much prior to the performance embargo in a couple of weeks we get one game only one game and we can't change the settings but I can't think of anything I'd want to change here absolutely everything is cranked and to their credit they did load up frame view so I won't be purely relying on feel to evaluate the difference okay so let's play on the 49 yep that's a pretty powerful GPU still and it's even more powerful than you probably realize before we move over to the 5090 this build of cyberpunk has some new goodness baked into it including nvidia's new Transformer model and the lss4 frame gen so the results we're getting even on the 4090 here are not going to be comparable to your system at home this guy is performing a little better thanks to some of these changes it's nice that it's getting the extra help because this is not close even without looking at the numbers which are double this is wickedly smooth I still remember I think it was on a short circuit or something we were looking at a system from um I want to say main gear it was my first time playing cyberpunk on the 4090 because I hosted the review and everything but I never actually got to game on it and I was like oh my god um yeah this a lot faster and it's like where are the polygons you know where have my polyes gone sure the thing is priced at $2,000 a 25% increase and is rated at 575 Watts but for the first time in what feels like forever at least we're getting more for the money this feels like a truly Halo tier product the 512-bit memory bus 5,000 more Cuda cor and noticeably better performance like I I can't believe that this is cyberpunk running at 4K with Ray tracing I can't believe it because it isn't frame gen and AI assisted Ray tracing are doing a lot of heavy lifting here Jensen gave us a bit of insight into this telling us that out of the about 33 million pixels in his demo only 2 million of them were calculated with the rest extrapolated using AI but okay I mean it doesn't matter as long as it looks good right so how good does it look well I'm supposed to be just showing this off what I've actually been doing is looking around for a couple of interesting examples of how dlss 4 doesn't handle everything perfectly see the way this text kind of jitters and blurs if I move around it's not as clear as the rest of the frame see it's okay if I do it's okay if I strafe and I've noticed some instances of particularly bright or high contrast objects having little ghosts on them with that said I know what I'm looking for other reviewers are going to know what they're looking for if I were to put one of my siblings in front of this looks pretty good and Nvidia was quick to point out that this is both running at lower latency and with fewer artifacts than dlss 3.5 enough about the 5090 that let's face it most people aren't going to buy let's talk about the rest of the family the RTX 570 comparison to the 490 should be taken with a grain of salt I mean obviously that's going to be with dlss version 4 obviously that's going to be using their new MFG or multi-frame generation at 4X that feature is limited to 50 Series cards and is powered by Ai and obviously the situation might change depending on the resolution you're running I mean 4K needs a fair bit of vram so can a few 100 more Cuda cor net such a wild performance boost especially with so much less vrm it's a bold claim but with this mix of next gen Cuda tensor and RT cores along with gddr 7 it could very well achieve it at least in some titles and if it looks anywhere near as good as this does while costing less than half of what the 490 did at launch well I certainly wish that it had 16 gigs of RAM but even without it they are going to sell a lot of these not to me you might say I want 16 gigs of vram well then you are going to need to take another step up to the 570 TI or another another step to the RTX 580 and about these if prices had stayed the same I'd probably be pretty pissed off right now but the 270 class cards they showed today are $50 less than last gen and I don't know if that's because of competition but hey progress and it actually gets better the RTX 580 with all the other bells and whistles that we've mentioned so far and sporting an additional thousand Cuda cor compared to its predecessor is set at just $9.99 I say just I know $1,000 is still really expensive but that is down $200 from the RTX 480 or about 16% it's got nextg everything a thousand more caor more than double the AI tops and more memory bandwidth meaning it should deliver legitimately Flagship class performance at that price even if they're does exist an even higher end card for the Mega Ballers out there right alongside their new desktop gpus Nvidia announced 50 Series for laptops as well they start as low as $12.99 with the RTX 5070 and they are claiming 4090 performance using half of the power and then the lineup goes all the way up to an RTX 590 at $28.99 by the way if you want to see our quick first initial reactions to msi's 50 Series cards when we under embargo and to watch us prank Colton why don't you check out our behind the scenes video over at lg. g/f floatplane but wait there's more Jensen brought a wafer prop onto the stage to illustrate the incredible technology that's built into their mv72 AI racks he described it as equal to 20 cars not 100% sure if he meant in terms of complexity with the 600,000 parts or Price either way each one draws 120,000 Watts contains 130 trillion transistors and has 1.4 exop flops fp4 but do what with it well I'm not sure yet but it's exciting and he wasn't done another big announcement is cosmos A World Foundation model that's designed and created to understand the physical world there are three levels of models and they're all openly licensed and available on GitHub Nano super and Ultra they're saying this is kind of the chat GPT moment for robots to help them interact with the real real world which is super cool and also kind of scary especially when they brought the army of robots onto the stage that was cool anyway the point is you should be able to give a robot a prompt and then just watch it do the thing in the virtual world so that it can train itself virtually they did it the Matrix but it's the humans bamboozling the robots dodged a bullet there anyway a big part of the reason for this is that when you're training something like a car you can just do it in the real world we're driving around with cameras all the time we've got lots of data but when it comes to humanoid robots it's a lot more challenging because they aren't just running around doing stuff cuz if they were it'd be extremely dangerous so the idea with Cosmos is to take the wear and tear out of the equation which will hopefully mean that costs can go way down in robotics development on a physical level just exactly what this is going to mean in the long term for everyone including potentially a lot of warehouse workers that aren't going to need to move things around anymore well I guess we'll see but wait there's even more Nvidia has announced you guessed it a ton of Partnerships around Robotics and Machine Vision promising to take the training that's happening in Cosmos and apply that to the real world that was coupled with their new Thor AV computer a Blackwell based robotics processor that also has their Grace arm CPU cores on it that can handle a ton of visual data at once like cameras radar and lidar they're boasting 20 times the processing power of their previous generation which is absolutely wild and last but not least they included a couple Illusions to the multi-trillion dollar industries that they're going to be addressing with all of this technology so will will Nvidia stock price or even higher thanks to our new robot overlords again I'm not sure because as Nvidia carefully noted all of these are forward-looking statements and uh can't be staken as pure fact finally last but not least they surprised everyone including Nintendo by announcing the switch too I'm kidding I'm kidding I know that didn't happen um anyway that's it the nearly 2hour keynote ended and I had just enough time after trying the RTX 590 to give you this segue to our sponsor Wicked cushions are your
